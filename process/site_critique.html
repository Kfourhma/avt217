	 <h1>Lomex Gallery</h1>
	<h3><a href="https://www.lomex.gallery/">https://www.lomex.gallery/</a></h3>
	<img src="img/LomexFrontpage.png" alt="The screen shot of the website">
	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>Navigation is extremely easy thanks to the simple style of the website and easily accessible banner.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Every link works properly and the important ones in the banner are easily accessible. Though I do dislike the store being an entirely different website.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The font is simple and the arrangement is nice and centered. I do like the vertical arrangement of the website.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>It's very minimalistic and unappealing on the front page, but once you dive into the exhibitions it showcases a lot of art and manages to slip past that boring white front page.</p>
